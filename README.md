# Time Lost by Fog APP

Idea for an app that calculates the amount of time of your life you lose (due to health problems) by inhaling smoky polluted air in cities. The idea would be to to have a few values for each city/region and whatever time you spend outside would count how many minutes of your life you're losing.

This idea was originally my pitch for a much bigger project in Ericsson Innovation Awards 2020, but I thought it was kinda silly.
